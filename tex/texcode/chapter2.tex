我不見他，已是三十多年；今天見了，精神分外爽快。纔知道以前的三十多年，全是發昏；然而須十分小心。不

\switchcolumn

I have not seen it in more than thirty years; after seeing it today, my spirits are especially
refreshed. Only now do I realize that for the past thirty years, I have been in a complete daze;
yet, I must be extremely cautious. Otherwise, why would the Zhao family's dog have looked at me

\switchcolumn*

我怕得有理。

\switchcolumn

I have reason to fear.
